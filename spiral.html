    <h1>Spiral One: Emotion as Frequency</h1>
    <p>What if emotions aren't internal at all, but like light or sound—signals that travel through us, waiting to be received?</p>
    <p>Some moments carry emotion like air carries scent. A grief can echo through a house. A joy can fill a forest. What is that, if not resonance?</p>
    <p>Maybe you're not the source. Maybe you're the instrument.</p>
